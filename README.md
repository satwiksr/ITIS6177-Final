# ITIS6177-Final


The Azure Face service provides AI algorithms that detect, recognize, and analyze human
faces in images. Facial recognition software is important in many different scenarios, such as
identity verification, touchless access control, and face blurring for privacy.

This particular project will act as an interface to execute the Azure API without explicitly
registering for the Azure API. The services provided are Face Detection and Face Verification.

Please refer to the Project report for the instructions on how to execute the API
